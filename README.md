# leaflet-challenge

added the two leaflet folders and the corresponding app.js's and htmls. Got the javascript files wrong, they're logic not app, 
forgot to add the html code when I created the file, and added the two examples of us going over them in class to get me started, the ones about the json pull.

okay stoped being stupid and fixating on the trying to convert the date, I was thinking that if I had a scroll bar down along the bottom over the last 7 days it would be cool.
But no more, that idea is stupid. Added a bunch of revert copies that I need to prune, had to work around a stupid issue this afternoon as to why the stlye css was giving me so much trouble
on load, turned out it was because it was nested wrong, got that fixed and BLAM, table and everything loaded. Knowing a bit about geology, I think that my additional layers are 
going to be the plate boundaries, the orogenic zones, since those are what cause a lot of earthquakes, one plate subducting underneath another  and I found two github filters that already had them coded as a json.
Stretch goal is going to be finding a ocean seabed topography, cause I think that would be neat, would show the mid-ocean trenches that are spliting or subducting, either way a lot of activity there and earthqaukes abound
